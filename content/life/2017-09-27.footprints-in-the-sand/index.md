One night a man had a dream

He dreamed He was walking along the beach with the LORD

&nbsp;

Across the sky flashed scenes from His life

For each scene He noticed two sets of footprints in the sand

One belonging to Him and the other to the LORD

&nbsp;

When the last scene of His life flashed before Him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand

He noticed that many times along the path of His life there was only one set of footprints

He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times of His life

&nbsp;

This really bothered Him and He questioned the LORD about it

LORD you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way

But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints

I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me

&nbsp;

The LORD replied

my precious, precious child, I Love you and I would never leave you!

During your times of trial and suffering when you see only one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you

&nbsp;
